/*
	Constructors are special functions which can be used for assigning values to the variables while instantiating the object
		Constructors have same name as class
		It intializes the data members of the class
		Constructors don't return a value, it takes value from user and pass on information to data member
		Default constructors which intialized default value
			Its a construcotr with no parameters
		They can be overloaded
		class_name(); --- Syntax
		
		Three types of constructors:
			1. Default Constructors 	2. Parametrized Constructors	3. Copy Constructors
		
	Destructors will delete the members, work is opposite to construcotrs
		Destructor has the same name along with a ~
		Doesn't return a parameter
		~class_name(); --- Syntax
		Explicit way to call destructors, but its highly discouraged
		Destructors cannot be overloaded
		Its automatically called by the compiler at the end of the program.
		
	Constructors and Destrucots comes under public, rarely they are mentioned in private.
	
Ques) Explain constructors and destrcutors and their differences.
