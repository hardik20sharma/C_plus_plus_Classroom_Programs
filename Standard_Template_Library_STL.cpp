Standard Template Library
	Collections of useful classes for common data structures
	Ability to store objects of any type (template)
	Study of containers	
	Containers from the basis for treatment of data structures
	Container - class that stores a collection of data
	
	STL contains of 10 super classes:
		1. Sequence Containers (Vector, Deque, List)
			Stores data by position in linear order
			First element, second element etc...
			
		2. Adapter Containers (Stack, queue, priority queue)
			Contains another container as its underlying storage structure
			
		3. Associative Containers (set, multiset, map, multimap)
			Stores elements by key such as name, social security number or part number
			Access an element by its key which may beat no relationship to location of the element in the containter
			
	
	Vector ( Header File: #include<vector> )
		Generalized array that stores a collection of elements of the same data type
		Similar to an array
			It allows access to its elements by using an index in the range from 0 to n-1 where n is the size of the vector
		Vector vs array
			Vector has operations that allow the collection to grow and contract dynamically at the rear of the sequence
		Syntax:
			vector <int> score(100);
